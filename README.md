# MangosGameEngine
My first attempt at creating a 3d engine.

This is my first  attempt at creating a 3-D graphics engine. It to SFML to render vertices to the screen. As SFML is a 2-D
graphics Library, this project was more of a proof of concept than a propper engine. Basically it was to test 
if my math was correct.

Hope you enjoy!
